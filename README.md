1. Download component
2. Disable the throw option on the XRGrabInteractable component
3. Add the component to the object that has XRGrabInteractable component attached
4. In serializefield set throw force and minimum magnitude that is required to throw the object
5. For me values that worked are:
    ThrowForce: 17000
    MinimumMagnitude: 500
